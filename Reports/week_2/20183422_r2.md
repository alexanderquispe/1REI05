Title: “Quality matters: the expulsion of professors and the consequences for PhD student outcomes in Nazi Germany”

University studies are a fundamental stage for the optimal development of people. For this reason, many university students strive to achieve a doctorate program and thus achieve a better quality of life. Between 1933-1934, thousands of professors were fired just because they were Jewish or had Jewish ancestry and were considered unreliable. This article tries to analyze "What is the relationship of the effect of the quality of the teaching staff on the results of doctoral students in the years 1929 and 1937". To do this, it uses the expulsion of several mathematics professors in the context of Nazi Germany as a source of exogenous variation in university quality. Next, the results of the investigation will be analyzed.

On the one hand, one of the strengths is that data was obtained from university students between the years 1920-1930, this allowed for a short- and long-term result. Combining data from doctoral students and data from German professors allowed the construction of annual measures for German mathematics faculties. On the other hand, it is difficult to form quality measures that reveal the aspects of university quality that matter to doctoral students. This produces an increase in bias in the OLS estimates. Likewise, there is a complication in the measures for university quality since the effects of this are hindered by the measurement error.

Then, the document presents the context in which his research will take place, the Second World War. In this context, the research will focus on the effect that the quality of the teaching staff had on the results of doctoral students. This research takes into account the dismissal of Jewish teachers as an important exogenous variable that negatively affected performance or future development in their different possible professional fields. In addition, it takes into account other factors that compare them with previous years and to be able to see the difference between these two realities, before 1933 and after 1933. Since during this year the largest number of dismissals were given to Jewish teachers. However, not all of these professors were of great importance in their faculty; so it also adds the students who were being mentored by Jewish teachers. On the other hand, the quality of the faculty and the relationship between faculty/student are taken as endogenous variables. In this way, the reduction in the quality of the faculty can be deduced that it was induced by the dismissal of professors. In the case of the students, three factors are considered to measure the degree of success that these students had before and after the mass dismissal of Jewish teachers. These factors are related to their job performance or their development in the mathematical field, such as the number of lifetime citations, being a tenured professor and the publication of a dissertation in a major journal. the quality of the faculty and the relationship between faculty/student are taken as endogenous variables.

With these variables and conditions that arise for comparison at different times between the years of 1929 to 1937, a decrease in the quality and "success" of the faculty and the student can be found. As Figure 3 shows, in faculties where Jewish mathematics professors were fired, a drop in the probability of a student publishing his or her dissertation can be observed, and with greater force around the years 1933. Likewise, the probability that the doctoral student finds a job as full professor decreases, although to a lesser extent; while on the side of the departments that did not have large dismissals of professors or there were no dismissals, a slight stability of these probabilities can be observed. Finally, the repercussion in the scientific and professional field,
In this way, the document addresses the initial research question and contributes to raising awareness of the importance of stability regarding the continuity of some professors, since the quality of the faculty or department is greatly affected and is reflected in his students.

In conclusion, Because this paper is some of the earliest research on this topic, one of the valuable next steps in further research or in providing more details or specifications might be to take into account other important factors that may have affected performance. of both students and teachers at the time of acquiring or providing knowledge, respectively. As, for example, the violent context of the Second World War could affect both emotionally and psychologically the students and teachers. Also an important factor could be the ease of having study space could have been impaired or mobilized, thus affecting the availability of both students and teachers.
