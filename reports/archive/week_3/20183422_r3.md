Title:  “The Role of Entrepreneurship in US Job Creation and Economic Dynamism”

Research question: How are start-ups and young companies that contribute significantly to job creation and productivity growth not a determining factor in explaining the slowdown in entrepreneurship and therefore of employment?

The economy is a fundamental factor in the countries. The US economy is considered one of the most flexible and innovative. However, some sources argue that the US economy is becoming less dynamic due to the slowing rate of business creation and the decline of young companies. The article has as a research question "In what way are emerging companies and young companies that contribute significantly to job creation and productivity growth, not a determining factor for the explanation of the fall in the pace of growth? Entrepreneurship and therefore employment? and aims to analyze this argument and verify whether these factors actually contribute to the reduction of incentives for entrepreneurs in the US.

On the one hand, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics provided information on job creation and destruction. A methodology was used that consists of measuring the age of the company. On the other hand, there is difficulty in measuring productivity at the company level. Likewise, company-level data sources do not incorporate micro-level measures of product prices. Finally, a reason for the decline of the enterprise could not be found.

The document begins by focusing on finding a relationship between productive activity and job creation with business dynamics, depending on each type of company. This document mentions young companies that have been around for approximately 5 years and new or emerging companies, companies that are just starting out. Next, this type of company is characterized and placed as a contributing factor for the increase or decrease in productivity or employment. Since in the time frame covered by this document, reasons or explanations for the net fall in employment are being investigated. As mentioned in the text, both young companies and emerging companies generate a large amount of employment; however, they also generate job destruction. This is because many of these companies fail to grow, prosper or adapt to market conditions in general. In this way, a comparison is made with mature companies (those that have been in the market for a long time), these generate a lower annual percentage of employment, but have greater stability, so jobs are not destroyed. The age of the company in the research is measured in different ways, such as using the age of the company's oldest establishment. Making a balance between job creation and job destruction, due to the factors mentioned among others, a counterweight is made of the contribution that comes out positive. So this is not a decisive factor to explain the fall in employment in the US. Likewise, other factors that may affect companies are investigated, such as the reallocation of resources in the economy; however, there are limitations to be able to calculate this factor in the different types of companies, since the Most of the firm- and facility-level data sources used to measure the productivity do not include micro-level measures of product and input prices. In this way, other variables can be found that can help find an explanation, such as the change in the industrial composition; but this would add more complexity to the question and not solve it.
However, this research, in search of an explanation for the drop in the pace of entrepreneurship, has contributed to relating different factors from the business point of view to the same issue, which is taking place in one of the most productive countries in the world and which therefore it can also happen in any other country. And it leaves several open questions, which can lead to further investigation.

One of the valuable next steps in advancing this question would be to address the issue of internal migration since the 1980s and relate it to trends in demographic change or broad economic factors. In the same way, this document leaves several open questions that can be approached from different points of view.
