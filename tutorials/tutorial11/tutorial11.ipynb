    "Difference in differences (DiD) is a tool to estimate treatment effects comparing the pre- and post-treatment differences in the outcome of a treatment and a control group. In general, we are interested in estimating the effect of a treatment Di (e.g. union status, medication, etc.) on an outcome Yi (e.g. wages, health, etc.) as in\n",

Individuals and time are indexed by $i$ and $t$, respectively. If there is a correlation between the fixed effects and $D_{it}$ then estimating this regression via OLS will be biased given that the fixed effects are not controlled for. This is the typical omitted variable bias."

Of course, only one of these is ever observable in practice. Therefore we look for people with the same pre-treatment trends in the outcome. Suppose we have two periods $t=1,2$ and two groups $s=A,B$. Then, under the assumption that the trends in the treatment and control groups would have continued the same way as before in the absence of treatment, we can estimate the treatment effect as"
